#--------------------------------------------------------------------Basic ggplot
#Aesthetics 1: axes
ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating)) 

#Geometry:adds plot points 
ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating)) +
  geom_point()

#Aesthetics 2: Add Color
ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating, color = Genre)) +
  geom_point()

#Aesthetics 3: Change Size of Plot Points
ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating, 
                          color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions)) +
  geom_point()

#-----------------------------------------------------------Plotting with Layers
#Using ggplot, the plot is an object
#thus, for each graphical layer, a + sign is required
#geometry is a layer  

#Create blank plot with axes as object p 
p = ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating, 
                              color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions)) 
p # p is now the above portion of the plot
#type ""+ geom_point" to add plot points to the plot p
p = p+ geom_point()
p

#plot lines instead of points
p = ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating, 
                              color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions))
p = p + geom_line()
p

#plot lines and points
p = ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating, 
                              color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions))
p= p+ geom_line() + geom_point() #in this order, lines are plotted on top of points, switch to plot points on top of lines
p

#---------------------------------------------------------------Overriding Aesthetics
#1. Override the size of plot points
q = ggplot(data = movies, aes(x=CriticRating,y=AudienceRating,
                               color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions))
q= q+geom_point(aes(size = CriticRating)) #override the size of points 
q

#2. Overide the color of plot points
q = ggplot(data = movies, aes(x=CriticRating,y=AudienceRating,
                              color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions))
q= q+ geom_point(aes(color = BudgetMillions)) #override the color of points
q

#3. Override an axis
q = ggplot(data = movies, aes(x=CriticRating,y=AudienceRating,
                              color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions))
q= q+ geom_point(aes(x = BudgetMillions)) +    #override the x-axis
  xlab("Budget Millions $$$")                  #Change the axis label 
q

#4.Multiple Geometries - adjust parameters of each geometry  
q = ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating, 
                              color = Genre, size = BudgetMillions ))
q= q+ geom_point() + geom_line(size = 1) #Change line thickness 
q
